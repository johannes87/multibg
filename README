multibg
=======

A simple command line tool for setting the background on X11 for multiple screens separately. 

For example, if you have two background images, "foo.png" and "bar.png",
the following will combine those two images into one, without distoring
the images, and then set it as a background image:

$ multibg.py foo.png bar.png

It uses Esetroot for setting the X11 background image, but you can
change the tool used. See "multibg -h" for more information.
